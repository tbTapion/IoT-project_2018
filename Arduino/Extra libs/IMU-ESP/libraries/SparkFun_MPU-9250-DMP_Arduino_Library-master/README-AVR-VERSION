---------------------------

Author: Dag Svanaes, NTNU.  (dags@idi.ntnu.no)
Date: July, 2018.

Changed files:
  inv_mpu.h
  inv_mpu.c
  inv_mpu_dmp_motion_driver.c
  SparkFunMPU9250.ccp

  
Background:
  The library did not work on AVR architecture Arduinos due to:
  1. Too little space for arrays in memory (in inv_mpu_dmp_motion_driver.c)
  2. A problem with float arithmetic (in SparkFunMPU9250.ccp)
  
Solution.
  1. The 3K of code for the IMU is moved into PROGMEM.
     Changes done to: inv_mpu.h, inv_mpu.c, inv_mpu_dmp_motion_driver.c
  2. "MPU9250_DMP::qToFloat" in SparkFunMPU9250.ccp is modified.
